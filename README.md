## About the Video Course
All major companies are now evolving from a monolithic to a microservices architecture in their websites and applications due to its many advantages. Early adopters of microservices have been able to provide an unprecedented level of control and speed as they deliver innovative web experiences to customers, and Netflix is a leading example.
The enterprise-grade architecture that we will build throughout the course will be highly maintainable and scalable. By exploring the intricacies of the microservices architecture you will understand its advantages over a monolithic and other related architecture. By going through multiple scenarios you'll learn where to use microservices and understand the things you should take into account when building your architecture. Advanced tasks—with concepts such as Serverless computing and DevOps using AWS—will also be undertaken to help you in your next venture with confidence.
By the end of the course, you will be ready to migrate to a microservices architecture in your organization.
